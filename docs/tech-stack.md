# Tech Stack and Justification

## Frontend
- React: component-based UI, strong ecosystem for charts and state management.

## Backend
- Node.js + Express: fast I/O, simple REST API composition, good for rapid iteration.

## Databases
- PostgreSQL: strong relational modeling for exams, users, and attempts; supports analytics queries.
- NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): stores high-volume analytics logs and event streams.

## Analytics
- Python + Pandas: efficient for batch analytics, pivot tables, and aggregations.

## Authentication
- JWT: stateless authentication for scalable API deployment.

## Optional Enhancements
- Redis: caching exam metadata and analytics summaries.
- Docker: repeatable environment and deployment.
- Cloud: managed Postgres and object storage for scale.
